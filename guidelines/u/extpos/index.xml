      <description>The ExtPos feature The ExtPos feature was introduced to facilitate the annotation of idioms, titles, and other multi-word phrases which behave like a certain part of speech, even though none of their constituents necessarily carry that part of speech. This feature allows the annotator to preserve the internal syntactic relationships between the various components of these units.
 The head of the phrase contains carries the ExtPos feature, which denotes the phrases&amp;rsquo;s function within the wider sentence.</description>

      <description>Idioms and titles SUD offers several traits which allow annotators to mark idiomatic expressions and titles while still preserving the internal syntactic relationships between their various components. We have decided to distinguish these two categories from Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs), which represent a broader category which also includes named entities.
For our purposes, &amp;ldquo;titles&amp;rdquo; refer to any title given to a film, book, painting, or other work of art, such as Planet of the Apes, Dark Side of the Moon, American Gothic, or Super Mario Bros.</description>
