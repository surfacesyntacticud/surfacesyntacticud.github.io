# **comp**
The `comp` relation is used for arguments of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries, adpositions and conjunctions.

This relation is refined into several sub-relations:  `comp:aux` (auxiliary argument), `comp:cleft` (cleft clauses), `comp:obj` (direct object),`comp:obl` (oblique argument), `comp:pred` (predicative argument).

Generally, corpora are directly annotated with the sub-relations, rather than with the `comp` relation.
