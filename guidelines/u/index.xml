      <description>Correspondences between SUD and UD This page is dedicated to exploring several key differences between SUD and UD labels, and the correspondences between the two schemes (For information about the conversion process, see SUD corpora).
SUD is a dependency-based annotation scheme. Annotation choices rely on surface-syntactic distributional criteria, while at the same time attempting to maintain convertibility with the UD annotation scheme as much as possible.
SUD represents an alternative rather than a competitor to UD, and was designed in such a way that the two can convey the same informational content.</description>

      <description>@fixed The @fixed feature is used for dependents on a word that form a multi-word expression (MWE) with it.
When a MWE has no internal syntactic structure, all components are linked in a chain from the left to the right by an unk@fixed relation.

      <guid>https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/guidelines/u/general_principles/</guid>
      <description>General principles The main differences with respect to UD are the following:
  The definition of relations is based on the syntactic position and not on semantic relations or the category of the dependents. In other words, two units that commute and exclude each other occupy the same position and must have the same function.
  Functional heads (instead of lexical heads): The head of a unit is the distributional head, that is, the element that control the distribution of the unit.</description>

      <guid>https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/guidelines/u/particular_phenomena/comparative/</guid>
      <description>Comparative, superlative and consecutive constructions In comparative constructions where each term is introduced with a grammatical pair like more&amp;hellip; than, the relation between the two grammatical words is labeled comp:obj, with the first word being the head of the second. Consider the example:
  # text = vous êtes plus jeune que moi # text_en = You are younger than me 1	Vous	vous	PRON	_	_	2	subj	_	Gloss=you 2	êtes	être	AUX	_	_	0	root	_	Gloss=are 3	plus	plus	ADV	_	_	4	mod	_	Gloss=more 4	jeune	jeune	ADJ	_	_	2	comp:pred	_	Gloss=young 5	que	que	SCONJ	_	_	3	comp:obj	_	Gloss=than 6	moi	lui	PRON	_	_	5	comp:obj	_	Gloss=I   Note that the first grammatical word of the comparison (plus) is considered a modifier of the property being compared.</description>

      <description>Coordination Chained conjuncts In UD, all conjuncts of a coordination are attached to the head of the first conjunct in a bouquet. In SUD, each conjunct is attached to the head of the previous one in a chain.
The first example below shows the annotation of a coordination in UD and the second one the corresponding annotation in SUD.

      <description>Idioms and titles SUD offers several traits which allow annotators to mark idiomatic expressions and titles while still preserving the internal syntactic relationships between their various components. We have decided to distinguish these two categories from Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs), which represent a broader category which also includes named entities.
For our purposes, &amp;ldquo;titles&amp;rdquo; refer to any title given to a film, book, painting, or other work of art, such as Planet of the Apes, Dark Side of the Moon, American Gothic, or Super Mario Bros.</description>

      <description>Light verb constructions A light verb construction (LVC) is a type of verbal structure in which a verb is coupled with another element – typically a noun phrase – which provides the primary semantic value. Common examples of LVCs in English include take a walk, give a kiss, or have a drink. In SUD, LVCs are marked with the deep feature @lvc.

      <guid>https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/guidelines/u/relations/comp/</guid>
      <description>comp The comp relation is used for arguments of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries, adpositions and conjunctions.
This relation is refined into several sub-relations: comp:aux (auxiliary argument), comp:cleft (cleft clauses), comp:obj (direct object),comp:obl (oblique argument), comp:pred (predicative argument).
In most cases, SUD native corpora are directly annotated with the sub-relations, rather than with the comp relation. However, comp may sometimes be used when one has difficulty deciding between comp:obj and comp:obl.</description>

      <description>comp:obl The comp:obl relation is used for oblique arguments of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, nouns or pronouns, regardless of their form. Unlike UD, SUD does not make a distinction between indirect objects and oblique arguments. SUD instead makes the distinction between arguments and modifiers.

      <description>udep The udep relation is used for complements when one does not wish to or is unable to distinguish between arguments and modifiers. This relationship can notably be used in cases where the complement&amp;rsquo;s relationship with its governor is ambiguous. When there is little debate about the nature of the relationship, the more specific label is preferred.
The governor and the dependent of a udep relation can have any POS. The udep relation is frequently given to the complements of nouns, since it is generally more difficult to distinguish between arguments and modifiers for nouns than it is for verbs.</description>
